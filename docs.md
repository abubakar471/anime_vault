# key notes
## infinite scroll 
    i have installed a package called react-intersection-observer to get to know about when we scroll to the bottom of the page.

    $ npm i react-intersection-observer

    so, once we install it, we can use it in our @/components/LoadMore module to add the infinte scroll and pagination.

## animations
    we are using framer motion for animations and visual effects
    # npm i framer-motion
